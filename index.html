                    Every 65 seconds, someone in the United States develops Alzheimers, But while you keep your mind active, your mental health is less likely to decline. In a study where almost 3.000 adults, aged 65 and above took part in brain training sessions. 
These 3.000 participants showed improvements in memory, reasonnig and speed of processing information for up to 5 years after the study was completed. 
While dementias is still somewhat uncharted teritory, and facts regarding these dementias are uncertain. However, another study shows that exercising the mind might delay rapid decline in thinking skills, such as memory and reasoning.
<br>
<br>
I have created MMrY for two reasons, I have a slowly growing relationship with dementias in my family, and so that we can help eachother be healthy. Are you on the buss or on the train and have five minutes to spare, engage your brain with this small but effective memory game.
