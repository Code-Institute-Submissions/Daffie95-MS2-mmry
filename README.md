# 1.Conclusions
> While I know that I could've done a much better project under the correct circumstances, it's making me feel quite sad that I am not able to deliver something that is up to MY standards. I am mentioning this in the additional comments below (8.). Due to multiple family members falling ill during the Covid-19 pandemic, I am put under very high stress and it is hard for me managing time to help my family with daily things they need help with and finding time to properly study.<br>

>this project is finished to the point of what I am capable with the given time I managed to pull away from other things. It is however not a depiction of what I am capable. I will most likely fail this milestone project, but there was nothing more I could've done with it.

The game works to a very very basic degree. The shuffle function works, which in my eyes was the most important function alongside getting the cards to match. 

# 2. Project Planning.
* Cards will mix on load or restart of the page.
* The game will know how to handle matched or unmatched cards.
* The game will count the number of moves the player has made.
* The game will start a timer when a player starts the game.<br>
When the game is finished, the timer stops.
* The game will have a restart button to let players reset the game.
* A message will be shown when the player finishes the game.

# 8. Additional Comments.
This year has been hard on all of us, and as I mentioned in my previous MS Project I've been having some difficoulties with finding time to commit into my studying.
There might be glaring issues with this project that I wont be able to fix in time. I've had to cancel mentoring sessions due to ill family members needing care and attention, and lacking behind in the actual course module. 
I will try my best with the time I have. <br>
I will make it very clear that there will be a lot of external code and resources used in this project.<br>
I have not been able to stay 100% up to date with the course module and I will not be able to finish this<br>
project in time if I'd choose to catch up on that before finishing this project. 
I assure that this code is 100% by hand and that I will only have been following external resource and not have copied anything.
## Due to very demanding Covid-19 problems in my family troughout december I have been set quite far behind, I have followed different opensource projects rather than speeding trough the course modules, however I have found them very good and explanitary. I know this is not ideal but to have this project submitted on time this was the only way I saw to be even close.
