This year has been hard on all of us, and as I mentioned in my previous MS Project I've been having some difficoulties with finding time to commit into my studying.
There might be glaring issues with this project that I wont be able to fix in time. I've had to cancel mentoring sessions due to ill family members needing care and attention, and lacking behind in the actual course module. 
I will try my best with the time I have.
