This year has been hard on all of us, and as I mentioned in my previous MS Project I've been having some difficoulties with finding time to commit into my studying.
There might be glaring issues with this project that I wont be able to fix in time. I've had to cancel mentoring sessions due to ill family members needing care and attention, and lacking behind in the actual course module. 
I will try my best with the time I have. <br>
I will make it very clear that there will be a lot of external code and resources used in this project.<br>
I have not been able to stay 100% up to date with the course module and I will not be able to finish this<br>
project in time if I'd choose to catch up on that before finishing this project.
